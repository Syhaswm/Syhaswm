#About me👋


**Syhaswm/Syhaswm** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.



- 🍀I want to know how to access GitHub more smoothly. Although I'm using Steam++, I still feel that the access is not smooth enough.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web Crawling.
- 💬 Ask me about web crawlers (excluding databases).
